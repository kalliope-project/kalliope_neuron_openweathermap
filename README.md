## Template and synapse example to get the forecast of a specific day with a single synapse

You need to translate all the days in the left column to your language in lowercase

```
{% set day_of_week = {

    "your_day_translation": "monday",
    "your_day_translation": "tuesday",
    "your_day_translation": "wednesday", 
    "your_day_translation": "thursday",
    "your_day_translation": "friday",
    "your_day_translation": "saturday", 
    "your_day_translation": "sunday"
    }[day] | default("")
-%}


{% if "today" == day_of_week %} 
The weather today will be {{ today['weather_status'] }} with temperatures from {{ today['min_temp'] }} to {{ today['max_temp'] }} degree

{% elif "monday" == day_of_week %} 
The weather on Monday will be {{ monday['weather_status'] }} with temperatures from {{ monday['min_temp'] }} to {{ monday['max_temp'] }} degree

{% elif "tuesday" == day_of_week %} 
The weather on Tuesday will be {{ tuesday['weather_status'] }} with temperatures from {{ tuesday['min_temp'] }} to {{ tuesday['max_temp'] }} degree

{% elif "wednesday" == day_of_week  %} 
The weather on Wednesday will be {{ wednesday['weather_status'] }} with temperatures from {{ wednesday['min_temp'] }} to {{ wednesday['max_temp'] }} degree

{% elif "thursday" == day_of_week  %} 
The weather on Thursday will be {{ thursday['weather_status'] }} with temperatures from {{ thursday['min_temp'] }} to {{ thursday['max_temp'] }} degree

{% elif "friday" == day_of_week  %} 
The weather on Friday will be {{ friday['weather_status'] }} with temperatures from {{ friday['min_temp'] }} to {{ friday['max_temp'] }} degree

{% elif "saturday" == day_of_week  %} 
The weather on Saturday will be  {{ saturday['weather_status'] }} with temperatures from {{ saturday['min_temp'] }} to {{ saturday['max_temp'] }} degree

{% elif "sunday" == day_of_week  %} 
The weather on Sunday will be {{ sunday['weather_status'] }} with temperatures from {{ sunday['min_temp'] }} to {{ sunday['max_temp'] }} degree

{%else %}
    I could not find that day
{% endif %}
